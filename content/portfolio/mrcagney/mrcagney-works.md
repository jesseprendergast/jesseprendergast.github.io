From 2019 to 2024, I was part of the MRCagney Data Science Team. They are a neat bunch of people doing awesome work in the transport, housing, land use, and emissions spaces - as well as much more.

A selection of projects worked on by the team (and me) can be found at [MRCagney Works](https://mrcagney.works).
